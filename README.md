# 🚀 React Projects Portfolio

This repository contains a collection of my React.js projects, built to strengthen my frontend development skills and showcase my work.

The apps are organized into two categories:

---

## 📦 Mini Projects (Logic-Focused)

| Project | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| [01 - Counter App](./mini-projects/01-counter-app) | Basic counter using `useState`, with increment, decrement, and reset functionality |

---

## 🌟 Major Projects (Scalable)

| Project | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| React Dashboard (coming soon) | Multi-page dashboard using React Router and JSONPlaceholder APIs |

---

## 🧠 Tech Stack

- React.js
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- React Hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`)
- Git & GitHub

---

## 🛠️ How to Run Any Project

```bash
cd mini-projects/project-folder-name
npm install
npm start
```

Replace `project-folder-name` with the folder you want to run, for example:

```bash
cd mini-projects/01-counter-app
```

## 🎯 Goal

This portfolio is part of my React learning journey to become a professional frontend developer. I am building it project-by-project to demonstrate my hands-on experience in React.
